This is the folder that contains all the files of the project.

1) .idea : The directory .idea contains some configuration files for the project which shall not be deleted at any cost.
2) Mastermind: The directory Mastermind contains all the code of the project including the make file and compiled .jar file.
3) ranking.txt : This text file contains the score of the players. Even if you delete it,  it will be regenerated
   everytime you play and finish a game. I recommend this file to be not deleted.

This folder also contains Equipo.pdf which has identity information of the members of the group.

If you want to check the code or execute it, the directory "Mastermind" is the one you should look for.
